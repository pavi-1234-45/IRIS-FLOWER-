# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a classic example of multi-class classification using machine learning.

## 📌 Project Description

Iris flower has three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

These species differ in terms of their **sepal** and **petal** measurements.  
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can learn from the given measurements and accurately **classify the species** of an iris flower.

## 🧠 Task

You are provided with a dataset containing:

- Sepal length and width
- Petal length and width
- Corresponding species label

Your task is to use this data to train a classification model using machine learning algorithms such as:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this task is the popular **Iris dataset**, which is also available in the Scikit-learn library.  
Alternatively, you can download the dataset from external sources if needed.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## ✅ Output

A trained ML model capable of predicting the **Iris species** given the flower's measurements.
